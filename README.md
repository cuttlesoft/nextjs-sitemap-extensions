‚ö°Ô∏è This repository demonstrates advanced SEO techniques for Next.js applications, focusing on adding sitemap extensions using next-sitemap.

For a more detailed explanation, see the accompanying blog post [Advanced Sitemaps with Next.js](https://cuttlesoft.com/blog/2024/08/30/advanced-sitemaps-with-next-js/).

## ‚¨ÖÔ∏è Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following dependencies installed on your computer:

- Node.js v18 or later
- NPM 9.x

## ‚ú® Features

This project demonstrates advanced SEO techniques for Next.js applications, focusing on:

- Implementation of video extensions in sitemaps using next-sitemap
- Custom transformation function for adding video metadata to sitemaps
- Integration with a headless CMS API to fetch video post data
- Dynamic generation of video-enhanced sitemaps during the Next.js build process
- Proper formatting of video extensions according to Google's sitemap protocol
- Optimization of sitemap generation for improved search engine indexing of video content


## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Quick start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the dev server
npm run dev

# (in a different terminal)
# Build the application for production
npm run build
```

**Note:** This example project is configured to call its own API routes during the build process to fetch data for sitemap generation. This is not a common practice in typical Next.js applications but is done here to make the example more self-contained and efficient. In a production environment, you would typically separate these concerns and fetch data from external APIs or databases.

Keep in mind that the sitemap generation occurs during the build process, not in development mode.
